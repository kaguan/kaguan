# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hello! I'm a 3rd year student at California State University Long Beach!
I mainly want to learn about data security and AI systems.
I'm currently learning about databases, operating systems, and algorithms.
Right now, I am focusing on leetcode problems and thinking of working on a small project with a few friends.
